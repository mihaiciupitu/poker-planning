## ðŸ§© Connect with API

Current app can connect with external [poker-API](https://github.com/mihaiciupitu/poker-api) to achieve full functionality considering that it requires a server which operates with sockets to communicate between users. 

**Steps**

- [x] Clone poker-api
- [x] Optionally install nodemon and run nodemon index.js / node index.js to start a server running on port 3000.
